</strong>Plan for learning jquery</strong>

1. Brief search on what jquery is, what it does, and why might it be useful.
2. See if anything needs to be installed or downloaded to access JavaScript library. If it does, then install on the spot.
3. Look up how jquery will interact with the html/css page
4. Learn basic syntax to require jquery for page. Go through basic methods to require jquery and practice jquery syntax as researching.
5. Learn basic jquery methods ("the essentials"), and test them out while everything is still fresh in your head.
6. Look into any best practices in case things get to be unreadable/repetitive. Note/highight these before submitting the project.
7. 5 minute break for when 2 bullet points are achieved from the plan.
