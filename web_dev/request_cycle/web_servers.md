1. What are some of the key design philosophies of a Linux operating system? From what I've read, the philosophy of an operating system is very telling of what it aims to achieve. For example, Windows philosophy is to "shield the users from everything that might get them into trouble." One way this can be interpreted is that its users would be afraid of computers and wouldn't know how to use them, and as a result, should be shielded from its complexities. This is the complete opposite or Unix's and Linux's philosophies which assumes that the users already know how to use and interact with a computer. Linux doesn't assume that is users are incompetent, and thus, doesn't shield it from complexities or prevent them from getting into trouble. Linux treats its users equally and allows them all free range to do something clever or even something bad. Linux gives you complete control by working on the command line. It's more transparent then Unix and Windows, and unlike Windows, it does not handhold.
