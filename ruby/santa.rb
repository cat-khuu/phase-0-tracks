# Your class should have three instance methods:

# A speak method that will print "Ho, ho, ho! Haaaappy holidays!"
# An eat_milk_and_cookies method that takes a cookie type (example: "snickerdoodle") as a parameter and prints "That was a good <type of cookie here>!"
# An initialize method that prints "Initializing Santa instance ...".
# Driver code

class Santa
  def initialize
    puts "Initializing Santa instance..."
  end

  def speak
    puts "*Ho, ho, ho! Haaaappy holidays!*"
  end
